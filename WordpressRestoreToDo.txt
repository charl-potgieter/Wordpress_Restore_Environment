Maybe separate into 3 scripts:
* Create environment
* Backup (incremental)
* Restore (again incremental))

Worth checking that all necessary programs are installed before running script?




Backup:

 * wget is going to have issues with files that are updated and then get duplicated.  Try lftp
 https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/lftp-mirror-example/
 https://randyzwitch.com/mirror-ftp-lftp/

  Below seems to be on the right track but needs to prompt for password
  lftp -e "mirror -c -e --parallel=20 --verbose /public_html /home/charl/temp_wp_backups/files;" ftp://username@powernumerics.com

   Now having certificate issue but maybe solvable with beliow

 * Work on below to FTP files:
    wget -O --ask-password -m ftp://username@powernumerics.com -P /TargetPath


All this may be overkill --> maybe just download from phpMyAdmin

* Mysql download - may need to use SSH ?
Below works (username and password are for the mysql datababase found in the wp-config.php file) but ..
NOTE: For above to work first need to add pc (host) IP address to godaddy cpanel under Remote Mysql

sudo mysqldump --column-statistics=0 -h powernumerics.com -u i8640980_wp1 -p --no-tablespaces i8640980_wp1 > ~/a432.sql






--> Maybe not:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2989724/how-to-mysqldump-remote-db-from-local-machine
mysqldump -h hostname-of-the-server -u mysql_user -p database_name > file.sql

# May have to add host ip?

   Below command seems to work inside ssh:
   mysqldump -h localhost -u jkdwrlryv6s3 -p --no-tablespaces i8640980_wp1 > file_name.sql

   And issued from a bash script
   ssh jkdwrlryv6s3@powernumerics.com mysqldump -h localhost -u jkdwrlryv6s3 -p --no-tablespaces i8640980_wp1 > ~/file_name_local.sql
   --> this saves to home directory on the client (as opposed to teh remote server)



   Should I potentially use the --all-databases option rather than having to specify the table --> will this work on import?
