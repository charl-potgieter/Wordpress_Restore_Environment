Maybe separate into 3 scripts:
* Create environment
* Backup (incremental)
* Restore (again incremental))

I think there was an issue with updating from example.com to live url but hopefully fixed now

Any way to encrypt my wsl home drive on dropbox?

Continue work on wordpress_create_restore_environment.sh
 - cannot log into phpMyAdmin but it may be the case that it needs the mysql database itself in place? --> maybe start to create a restore script and see how things go?
