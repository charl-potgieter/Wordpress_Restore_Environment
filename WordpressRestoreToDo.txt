Maybe separate into 3 scripts:
* Create environment
* Backup (incremental)
* Restore (again incremental))

Store below in config file:
 - backup path
 - domain
 - ssh  = cpanel = mysql user
  - https://askubuntu.com/questions/743493/best-way-to-read-a-config-file-in-bash
   - https://opensource.com/article/21/6/bash-config
  - read password once when scripts is being run




Backup:
 * Work on below to FTP files:
    wget --ask-password -m ftp://username@powernumerics.com -P /TargetPath

* Mysql download - may need to use SSH ?

   Below command seems to work inside ssh:
   mysqldump -h localhost -u jkdwrlryv6s3 -p --no-tablespaces i8640980_wp1 > file_name.sql

   And issued from a bash script
   ssh jkdwrlryv6s3@powernumerics.com mysqldump -h localhost -u jkdwrlryv6s3 -p --no-tablespaces i8640980_wp1 > ~/file_name_local.sql
   --> this saves to home directory on the client (as oposed to teh remote server)



   Should I potentially use the --all-databases option rather than having to specify the table
